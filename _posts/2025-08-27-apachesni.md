## Tech Tip: Fixing 421 Misdirected Request SNI Issues Between HAProxy and Apache

### Overview
The HTTP 421 "Misdirected Request" error typically occurs when Apache receives an HTTPS request with an SNI hostname that doesnâ€™t match its configured virtual hosts. This often happens when HAProxy is used as a reverse proxy in front of Apache and does not correctly forward or handle the Server Name Indication (SNI) during TLS negotiation.

---

### Why It Happens
- Apache requires the correct SNI hostname during the TLS handshake to serve the right site.
- Newer Apache versions enforce stricter SNI checks for security.
- If HAProxy does not properly forward SNI information, Apache returns a 421 error indicating the request was sent to a server that cannot handle it.
