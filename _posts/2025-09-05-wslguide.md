# WSL Guide for Windows 11

*Inspired by NetworkChuck’s practical approach, adapted for any Linux distro!*

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Windows 11** (preferred for best compatibility)
- **64-bit CPU with virtualization enabled**  
  - Enable virtualization (Intel VT-x / AMD-V) in your BIOS/UEFI if not already enabled.
- **Windows Terminal** is recommended (available in the Microsoft Store).

---

## 2. Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

Open **Windows Terminal** as Administrator and run:

```
powershell
wsl --install
```
- This installs WSL 2 by default and also installs Ubuntu, but you can skip Ubuntu and install another distro (see below).

Reboot your PC when prompted.

---

## 3. Install a Different Linux Distribution

### To see available Linux versions:
```
powershell
wsl --list --online
```
### Example: Install openSUSE Tumbleweed
```
powershell
wsl --install -d openSUSE-Tumbleweed
```
- Substitute `openSUSE-Tumbleweed` with any listing from the previous command (Fedora, Debian, Alpine, etc).

### Alternative: Via Microsoft Store

- Open the **Microsoft Store**
- Search for your preferred distro (e.g., Fedora, Debian, Alpine, SUSE)
- Click **Install**

---

## 4. Initial Setup

- On first launch, create a new UNIX username & password. This is your Linux account.

---

## 5. Keeping Your WSL Distributions Up-to-Date

**Update the Linux Kernel (if prompted):**
```
powershell
wsl --update
```

**Update Linux Packages (inside your distro):**

- For **Debian/Ubuntu/derived**:
  ```
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
  ```
- For **openSUSE**:
  ```
  sudo zypper refresh
  sudo zypper update
  ```
- For **Fedora**:
  ```
  sudo dnf upgrade --refresh
  ```

---

## 6. Basic WSL Management

- List installed distros:  
  `wsl --list --verbose`
- Shutdown WSL completely:  
  `wsl --shutdown`
- Change default distro:  
  `wsl --set-default <distro-name>`
- Terminate a single distro:  
  `wsl --terminate <distro-name>`

## 7. Troubleshooting: Resetting the Root Password

If you forget/lost your root password for a WSL distro:

**a. Launch as Root (no password needed):**
```
powershell
wsl -d <distro-name> -u root
```

**b. Reset Your User Password**
```
passwd username
```
(Enter and confirm your new password.)

**List all users if needed:**
```
cat /etc/passwd
```

**c. Exit and Relaunch Normally**
- Close the terminal and start your Linux session as usual.

---

## 8. Extra Tips

- **Access Windows files from Linux:**  
  `cd /mnt/c`
- **Access Linux files from Windows:**  
  Open Windows Explorer and go to: `\\wsl$\\<distro-name>\\home\\<your-username>`
- **Backing Up & Restoring WSL Instances:**
  - Backup:  
    ```
    powershell
    wsl --export <distro-name> <backup-file.tar>
    ```
  - Restore:  
    ```
    powershell
    wsl --import <new-distro-name> <install-location> <backup-file.tar>
    ```

## Bonus: GUI Integration and Docker Support

### A. GUI Integration with WSLg

**Windows 11** (and updated Windows 10) includes **WSLg** (Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI), so you can run Linux graphical apps natively.

#### How to Use

- Launch GUI apps in your Linux terminal, e.g.:
  ```
  gedit
  xeyes
  ```
- No extra setup needed; Windows handles display and audio.
- GUI apps appear alongside Windows apps.

**To install more GUI apps:**
- For openSUSE:
  ```
  sudo zypper install gedit xeyes x11-tools
  ```
- For Fedora:
  ```
  sudo dnf install gedit xeyes x11-tools
  ```

### B. Docker Support on WSL2

1. **Install Docker Desktop** (from the official Docker website).
2. During setup, select **“Use WSL2 instead of Hyper-V”**.
3. Launch Docker Desktop, verify your WSL2 distros are listed in  
   **Settings > Resources > WSL Integration**.
4. Enable integration for your distro.
5. From your WSL terminal, test Docker:
   ```
   docker --version
   docker run hello-world
   ```
